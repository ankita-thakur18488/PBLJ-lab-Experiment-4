Experiment 4.2: Card Collection System

Objective:
Develop a Java program that collects and stores playing cards to help users find all the cards of a given symbol (suit).
The program should utilize the Collection interface (such as ArrayList, HashSet, or HashMap) to manage the card data efficiently.

Understanding the Problem Statement

1. Card Structure:
Each card consists of a symbol (suit) and a value (rank).

Example card representations:
Ace of Spades
King of Hearts
10 of Diamonds
5 of Clubs

2. Operations Required:
Add Cards → Store card details in a collection.
Find Cards by Symbol (Suit) → Retrieve all cards belonging to a specific suit (e.g., all "Hearts").
Display All Cards → Show all stored cards.

3. Collections Usage:
ArrayList: To store cards in an ordered manner.
HashSet: To prevent duplicate cards.
HashMap<String, List<Card>>: To organize cards based on suits for faster lookup.


Test Cases

Test Case 1: No Cards Initially
Input:
Display All Cards
Expected Output:
No cards found.

Test Case 2: Adding Cards
Input:
Add Card: Ace of Spades
Add Card: King of Hearts
Add Card: 10 of Diamonds
Add Card: 5 of Clubs
Expected Output:
Card added: Ace of Spades
Card added: King of Hearts
Card added: 10 of Diamonds
Card added: 5 of Clubs

Test Case 3: Finding Cards by Suit
Input:
Find All Cards of Suit: Hearts
Expected Output:
King of Hearts

Test Case 4: Searching Suit with No Cards
Input:
Find All Cards of Suit: Diamonds
(If no Diamonds were added)
Expected Output:
No cards found for Diamonds.

Test Case 5: Displaying All Cards
Input:
Display All Cards
Expected Output:
Ace of Spades
King of Hearts
10 of Diamonds
5 of Clubs

Test Case 6: Preventing Duplicate Cards
Input:
