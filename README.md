# PBLJ-lab-Experiment-4 (Collection Framework)

## Topics Covered
- **Collections in Java**
  - `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, `HashSet`
- **Multithreading in Java**
  - Thread Synchronization
  - Thread Priority
  - Thread LifeCycle
    

## ðŸ“Œ Experiment: Develop Java programs using core concepts such as data structures, collections, and multithreading to manage and manipulate data.

| Program | Description                                 |
|---------|---------------------------------------------|
| **[4.1) Employee Management System](/Exp4.1.java)** | Write a Java program to implement an ArrayList that stores employee details (ID, Name, and Salary). Allow users to add, update, remove, and search employees. |
| **[4.2) Card Collection System](/Exp4.2.java)** | Create a program to collect and store all the cards to assist the users in finding all the cards in a given symbol using Collection interface. |
